Code Book for the file tidyData.txt
Introduction: The file tidyData is generated with the Program cleanData. The program reads six different files
activity_labels 	This file is used to replace the number of the activity by a string which 			describes the activity
feature_names Names of all features measured 
X_train,X_test	Values of all features in feature_names
y_train,y_test	Activity during measurement, the mapping to the activity string is done by 		the file activity_labels
cleanData calculates the mean value depending of subject(person_id) and activity of the mean and standard deviation of all features.
tidyData contains the following colums
person_id	An integer value between 1 and 30 which describes the person 
activity		A string which describes the activity during the telephone call. Six different 		values are allowed WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, 					WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING and LAYING
Measurements	The following meaurements are taken:
